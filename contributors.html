<h2>Contributors</h2>
<p>Many people worked on making Piston a better tool.  In no particular order:</p>
<dl class="contributors">
  <dt>Paul Watson</dt>
  <dd><p>Paul contributed a couple of fixes to Git support early during my rewrite.  I don't have a link for Paul, so if you recognize your <a href="http://github.com/francois/piston/commit/7d815cd1c4faf081b710d1f6ead5fb324bcc2fb6">commit</a>, send me an email!</p></dd>

  <dt><a href="http://technicalpickles.com/">Josh Nichols</a> (also known as technicalpickles)</dt>
  <dd><p>Josh contributed the --repository-type option to the import subcommand and reorganized the tests.  He also made the update subcommand safe in the face of errors.</p></dd>

  <dt><a href="http://blog.improveit.com.br/">Marcos Tapaj√≥s</a></dt>
  <dd><p>Marcos contributed lock and unlock.  Marcos also worked hard to refactor the test suite.</p></dd>

  <dt><a href="http://github.com/scambra">Scambra</a></dt>
  <dd><p>Scambra single-handedly made the update command do all the nice things: adds, deletes, changes, as well as handling local changes.  When I began writing Cucumber tests, they were all green thanks to Scambra's hard work.</p></dd>

  <dt><a href="http://nubyonrails.com/">Geoffrey Grosenbach</a> (also known as topfunky)</dt>
  <dd><p>Geoffrey contributed the first gemspec.</p></dd>

  <dt>Sergio</dt>
  <dd><p>Sergio contributed import subcommand improvements.  When you run import without specifying the 2nd (optional argument), Sergio's code is choosing a reasonable default behind the scenes.  I don't have a link for Sergio, so if you recognize one or more of your <a href="http://github.com/francois/piston/commit/2c71de586dd65552239a87711a0b46720de3804b">commits</a>, send me email!.</p></dd>

  <dt>Psyche</dt>
  <dd><p>Psyche contributed some subcommand refactorings.  I don't have a link for Psyche, so if you recognize your <a href="http://github.com/francois/piston/commit/7c99ed8bf57643d974323b9120739c4961fc286e">commit</a>, send me email!</p></dd>
